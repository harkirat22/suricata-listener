## Suricata Listener
Suricata Listener is a tool designed to continuously monitor and process logs generated by Suricata, an IDS/IPS system, providing real-time analysis and potential threat mitigation.

## Features

*Real-time Log Processing*: Actively listens for new logs and processes them immediately. It uses fsnotify to keep a watch on the new entries to eve.json log file generated by suricata.
*Integration with Kubernetes*: Can be deployed as a DaemonSet to monitor Suricata logs across nodes.
*Policy Enforcement with OPA*: Leverages Open Policy Agent (OPA) to evaluate Suricata alerts against defined policies.

## Prerequisites

A running Suricata setup.
Kubernetes cluster for DaemonSet deployment.
Docker, if running in containers.
Installation & Deployment

### Docker
To build and run the Suricata Listener using Docker:
docker build -t suricata-listener .
docker run -v /path/to/suricata/logs:/var/log/suricata suricata-listener
Kubernetes
Refer to the provided Terraform configuration to deploy Suricata Listener as a DaemonSet in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Usage
Once deployed, the Suricata Listener will continuously monitor the designated log directory (/var/log/suricata by default) for new log entries in eve.json which has a structure of a newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) format. When an alert is detected, it will evaluate the entry against the defined policies in OPA.
